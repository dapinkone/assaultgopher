* HOLD [#A] BUG: client times out on state.json?
  2021/03/29 01:57:15 Get "https://www.saltybet.com/state.json": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
  exit status 1
  2021/04/03 Haven't seen this error in some time. I previously increaed the Client.Timeout limit. That may have been the fix.
* ✔DONE BUG: possible rounding error in estProfit causes currBalance to drift over longer periods.
  CLOSED: [2021-04-04 Sun 11:13]
* ✔DONE BUG: occasionally SB reports the same victory twice. Our checks for this are not working, and the profit is likewise counted twice.

* TODO Tournament mode
** They do some weird things with the balance here. It throws off our estimated balance.
** TODO BUG: our betting strategy seems excessively nieve during tournaments.
   Perhaps with more/better data we can build a ranking tree or something?
* TODO Exhibition mode
** Not useful for historical/ranking purposes, as team names are random user-submitted garbage?
* INWK Implement betting/ranking strategy
* TODO support for "bailout" detection. Go all in if our balance is below where we'll be bailed out.
* TODO major refactor. Code feels like pasta.
* TODO BUG: player names may not be unique(both players may have same name). This can lead to some mix ups somewhere, such as predictedWinner == winnerName
* TODO BUG: appears to lock up after a couple days. Connection timeout or something?
